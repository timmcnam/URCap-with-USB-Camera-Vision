# URCap-with-USB-Camera-Vision
This is a URCap in development with the Cobot Senior Design Team at Purdue University Indianapolis. The intentions of this URCap are to take a USB camera connection, show an 8.5 X 11 inch letter stock paper and the cobot will draw the image it sees. 
The area it draws on is a whiteboard that is 24X18 inches and the cobot takes it's TCP and trace the outline it sees with the camera with edge detection. 

3/10/2025 - This URCap is still in development. Consulting the forum for help with UI and URScript execution.
